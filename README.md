# Proxmox on Dell Wyse 5070

## Goal
Install Proxmox VE on Dell Wyse 5070 and enhace it, i.e. updagrade it, as much as possible to maximize its utility.

## Restrictions
* Upgrade using only COTS components that are readily avaialble.
* No hardware hacking.  This is not my strenght, so just focusing on items that can be connected, plugged-in, snapped-in, etc.
* Software hacking is allowed, but would like to minimize it to prevent maintenance issues.
